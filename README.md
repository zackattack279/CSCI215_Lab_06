# CSCI215_Lab_06
Styling and validating a form

This will be a two-part lab. Part 1 will consist of creating a form in HTML and style in CSS. This will emphasize skill that were learned in CSCI-115 but will also improve on design elements that are crucial in Website Programming. Part 2 will incorporate the JavaScript language to be used for form validation. Fork and Clone this repository. Initial files have been provided.

## Part 1
Perform the steps in **Tutorial: Styling a Form**. These steps can be found in the PDF directory. Before performing the step, observe the initial look and feel. Part 1 will improve on this.

## Part 2
Write JavaScript that will check the user's name to ensure that it only contains valid letters for a name, check that the user inputted a number for age, and that a proper email was submitted. These should be contained in their own functions called, for example **checkName(), checkAge(), and checkEmail()**. Add a click listener on to the subscribe button. When a user clicks submit, the checkName(), checkAge(), and checkEmail() functions should be called (**HINT: create one function called validate() that calls the three required functions**). If any of the fields are invalid, change the background color of that input to red and do not submit. If all inputs are correct, **alert** the user that their subscription was submitted.
